# SPIN animation tool

This Blender add-on has three pre-defined spin animations that can be
applied to any mesh, named after three of the greatest YouTube instructors.

        ---WENBO is a simple linear turntable animation. This is useful for
        showing a product or a general 360 degree view of anything really.

        ---DERRK is a 360 rotation that speeds up and slows down paced by
        a bezier curve. This is a more sexy way to show a product, good for
        an advertisement perhaps.

        ---DUCKY is more of a motion graphic type spin.

All three spins are adjustable. Parameters are easily accessible in the modifier
stack (the wrench icon).

I created this add-on mostly to demonstrate how easy it is to create animations
that are programmable, and modifiable using Geometry Nodes. These are intended to work
on any single mesh. But for animations that are to work with complex models with
rigging like Mixamo, where multiple animations are required (ie an arm moves and then the hand
grips and together they shake hands, or a walk cycle that involves legs and feet) of course this add-on would need to be more detailed. But I'm pretty sure with a little bit of effort I would be able to create an add-on that accomplishes similar pre-defined animations on characters with the click of a button. If there is any interest please reach out and let me know!

I hope you enjoy this Spin add-on. Thanks for taking a look. :)
